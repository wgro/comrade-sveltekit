In a social media post, former U.S. President Donald Trump claimed that any documents signed by Joe Biden with a "fountain pen" were "canceled." He stated that approximately 92% of documents signed by Biden were done so with a fountain pen, and these are now void. Trump further asserted that using a fountain pen for such purposes is not allowed unless the President provides special approval, and that any documents not directly signed by "Cheating Joe Biden" are being canceled because the individuals using the fountain pens did so illegally.[1][2][3][4]

This claim by Trump is in the context of his broader allegations regarding Biden's use of an autopen, a mechanical device that replicates a signature. Trump has claimed that Biden's reliance on the autopen indicates a lack of cognitive ability and that documents signed this way are invalid.[5]

However, the U.S. Department of Justice, in a 2005 opinion, stated that a president does not need to personally sign a bill to enact it into law. The DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel concluded that a president can sign a bill by directing a subordinate to affix the signature, including through the use of an autopen.

Furthermore, The New York Times reported in 2011 that Barack Obama was the first president to sign a bill using a fountain pen while in Europe. Despite the existence of autopen technology and historical presidential usage, Trump has recently focused his criticism on Biden's use of it, particularly for pardons.

In the final days of his presidency, Joe Biden did issue a number of pardons. These included pardons for his son, members of Congress who investigated Trump, a military general who had criticized Trump, and a leading COVID expert.
